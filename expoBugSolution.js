The solution often involves carefully checking the Android build logs for more specific error messages.  Common causes and solutions include:

1. **Gradle issues:** Update Gradle to the latest version. Check for Gradle wrapper conflicts.
2. **Dependency conflicts:** Review your `package.json` file. Carefully check for version mismatches and potential conflicts among your project's dependencies. Update or remove packages if necessary.
3. **Android SDK issues:** Ensure that your Android SDK is properly configured and that all necessary components are installed and up-to-date. 
4. **Incorrect Project Configuration:** Review all the Expo specific configurations in your project, like `app.json`

The `expoBugSolution.js` file shows how to fix the common issues. The primary focus is on debugging the build process by carefully examining the logs for detailed error messages.
